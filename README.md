# Employee Records Management System  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Employee Records Management System** is a Spring Boot-based CRUD application that allows users to manage employee data efficiently. It provides RESTful APIs to perform operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee records.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Frontend (Optional for UI):** Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS  
- **Server:** Tomcat (Embedded)  
- **Tools & Platforms:** Postman, MySQL Workbench, IntelliJ/VS Code  

## 🚀 Features  
✔️ **CRUD Operations** – Create, Read, Update, and Delete employees  
✔️ **RESTful APIs** – Seamless integration with frontend or third-party services  
✔️ **Spring Boot with Hibernate** – Simplified database interactions  
✔️ **Data Validation** – Ensures data integrity with validation rules  
✔️ **Exception Handling** – Graceful error messages and handling mechanisms  
✔️ **MySQL Integration** – Persistent employee records stored in MySQL

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation  
1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Employee-Records.git
cd Employee-Records
```
2️⃣ **Configure MySQL Database**  
- Create a database named `employeedb` in MySQL  
- Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your MySQL credentials  
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employeedb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```
3️⃣ **Build and Run the Application**  
```sh
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
4️⃣ **Test the APIs using Postman or Browser**  
- Open Postman and make requests to `http://localhost:8080/employees`  

## 🏆 Outcome  
- Successfully implemented a CRUD-based employee management system  
- Gained hands-on experience in Spring Boot, Hibernate, and RESTful APIs  
- Designed scalable and efficient database interactions using Spring Data JPA
